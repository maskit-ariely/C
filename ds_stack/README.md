# Stack implementation in C

This is a stack data structure implementation in C, based on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, which allows for elements to be added (pushed) or removed (popped) from the top.

## Features

- Essential stack operations like push, pop and peek.
- Utility Functions like empty and size checks.
- Capability to quickly free up memory once the stack is no longer in use.
## Requirement

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine (e.g., GCC).
## Compilation

A Makefile is included in the repository to simplify the compilation process.<br>
To compile your C code and generate the executable, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.
3. To compile the code, simply run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
4. Execute the program with the following command:
   ```bash
   ./stack.out
   ```
